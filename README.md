# Wildlife Conservation App

## Purpose

The Wildlife Conservation App is a comprehensive platform designed to engage users in wildlife conservation efforts through technology. Our app empowers nature enthusiasts, researchers, and conservationists by providing tools for species identification, tracking animal sightings, and fostering community engagement in conservation projects.

Key objectives:
- Facilitate easy and accurate identification of animal species using AI technology
- Create a centralized database of animal sightings to aid in conservation research
- Build a community of wildlife enthusiasts and promote knowledge sharing
- Raise awareness about ongoing conservation efforts and provide opportunities for involvement
